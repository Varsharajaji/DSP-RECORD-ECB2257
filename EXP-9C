DIVISION USING DIRECT ADDRESSSING MODE 
 
AIM: 
 
To write an assembly language program to perform division of two numbers using direct addressing mode. 
 
APPARATUS  REQUIRED: 
 
1.	Personal computer 
2.	RS232C interface cable 
3.	TMS320C5416 DSP Processor 
 
ALGORITHM: 
 
•	Set the data memory locations of Dividend, Divisor, Quotient and Remainder. 
•	Start the program 
•	Initialize the data memory page. 
•	Reset the Complier mode (CPL) bit and fractional mode (FRCT) bit. 
•	Delay is given by NOP (No Operation). 
•	Dividend data is loaded into Accumulator A. 
•	Data which is in Accumulator A is divided by divisor and the result is stored in Accumulator A. 
•	Lower 16 bit Result (Quotient) of Accumulator A is stored at A002H. 
•	Higher 16 bit Result (Remainder) of Accumulator A is stored at A003H. 
•	Halt the program.
