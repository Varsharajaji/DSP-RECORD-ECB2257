MULTIPLICATION USING DIRECT ADDRESSSING MODE 
 
AIM: 
 
To write an assembly language program to perform multiplication of two numbers using indirect addressing mode. 
 
APPARATUS  REQUIRED: 
 
1.	Personal computer 
2.	RS232C interface cable 
3.	TMS320C5416 DSP Processor 
 
ALGORITHM: 
 
•	Start the program • Clear the Accumulator A • Load the Data pointer. 
•	Load the First and second input. 
•	Perform the multiplication . 
•	Store the result in Accumulator A. 
•	Halt the program.
