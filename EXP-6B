IIR  BUTTERWORTH  HIGH  PASS  FILTER 
	
AIM: 
To   design   an IIR Butterworth  high  pass filter and to plot   magnitude  & phase  response. 
 
SOFTWARE  REQUIRED: 
 
MATLAB (R2020) Software. 
 
ALGORITHM: 
•	Start the program 
•	Get the pass band attenuation(ap) & stop band attenuation (as) 
•	Get the pass band frequency (fp) & stop band frequency (fs) & sampling frequency 
•	Find the order of the Butterworth highpass filter 
•	Find the filter coefficients & transfer function for the given specifications 
•	Obtain the magnitude response & phase response   
•	Plot the magnitude response and phase response  
•	Stop the program 

PROGRAM: 
 
clc; clear all; close all; ap=0.5; as=50; fp=1000; fs=2000; f=5000; wp=2*fp/f; ws=2*fs/f; wn=[wp,ws]; 
 
%TO FIND THE CUT OFF FREQ&ORDER OF FILTER 
[n,wn]=buttord(wp,ws,ap,as); [b,a]=butter(n,wn,'high'); w=0:0.01:pi; h=freqz(b,a,w); p=angle(h); mag=20*log10(abs(h)); subplot(2,1,1); plot(w/pi,mag); grid; xlabel('normalized frequency'); ylabel('magnitude in db-->'); title('magnitude response(highpass filter)'); subplot(2,1,2); plot(w/pi,p); grid; xlabel('normalized frequency-->'); ylabel('phase in radians-->'); 
title('phase response(highpass filter)'); 
 

 
RESULT: 
 
Thus the IIR Butterworth High Pass Filter was designed and executed using MATLAB.
