IIR  BUTTERWORTH  BAND  PASS FILTER 

AIM: 
 
To  design  an   IIR Butterworth  Band pass filter  and to plot  magnitude & phase  response. 
 
SOFTWARE   REQUIRED: 
 
MATLAB  (R2020) Software. 
 
ALGORITHM: 
 
•	Start the program 
•	Get the pass band attenuation(ap) & stop band attenuation (as) 
•	Get the pass band frequency (fp) & stop band frequency (fs) & sampling frequency 
•	Find the order of the Butterworth bandpass filter 
•	Find the filter coefficients & transfer function for the given specifications 
•	Obtain the magnitude response & phase response   
•	Plot the magnitude response and phase response  
•	Stop the program 

PROGRAM: 
 
clc; clear all; close all; ap=0.5; as=50; fp=1000; fs=2000; f=5000; wp=2*fp/f; ws=2*fs/f; wn=[wp,ws]; 
[n]=buttord(wp,ws,ap,as); [b,a]=butter(n,wn,'bandpass'); w=0:0.01:pi; h=freqz(b,a,w); p=angle(h); mag=20*log10(abs(h)); subplot(2,1,1); plot(w/pi,mag); grid; xlabel('normalized frequency'); ylabel('magnitude in db-->'); title('magnitude response(band pass filter)'); subplot(2,1,2); plot(w/pi,p); grid; xlabel('normalized frequency-->'); ylabel('phase in radians-->'); 
title('phase response(band pass filter)'); 

 
RESULT: 
 
Thus the IIR Butterworth band pass filter was designed and executed using MATLAB.
