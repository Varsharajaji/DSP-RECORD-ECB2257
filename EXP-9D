ADDITION USING INDIRECT ADDRESSSING MODE 
 
AIM: 
 
To write an assembly language program to perform addition of two numbers using indirect addressing mode. 
 
APPARATUS  REQUIRED: 
 
1.	Personal computer 
2.	RS232C interface cable 
3.	TMS320C5416 DSP Processor 
 
ALGORITHM: 
 
•	Start the program 
•	Clear the Accumulator A 
•	Indirect address 1000H is assigned to auxiliary register AR4. 
•	Indirect address 1000H is assigned to auxiliary register AR5. 
•	Indirect address 3000H is assigned to auxiliary register AR6. 
•	Data which is in 1000H is loaded to Accumulator A. 
•	Data which is in 2000H is added with Accumulator A. 
•	Result in Accumulator A is stored at 3000H. 
•	Halt the program.
