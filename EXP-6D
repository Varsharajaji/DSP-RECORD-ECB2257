IIR BUTTERWORTH   BAND  STOP  FILTER 

AIM: 
 
To   design   an  IIR butterworth   band stop  filter and to plot magnitude  &  phase  response. 
 
SOFTWARE REQUIRED: 
 
MATLAB  (R2020) Software. 
 
ALGORITHM: 
 
•	Start the program 
•	Get the pass band attenuation(ap) & stop band attenuation (as) 
•	Get the pass band frequency (fp) & stop band frequency (fs) & sampling frequency 
•	Find the order of the Butterworth bandstop filter 
•	Find the filter coefficients & transfer function for the given specifications 
•	Obtain the magnitude response & phase response   
•	Plot the magnitude response and phase response  
•	Stop the program 
 

PROGRAM: 
 
clc; 
clear all; 
close all; 
ap=0.5; 
as=50;
fp=1000; 
fs=2000;
f=5000;
wp=2*fp/f; 
ws=2*fs/f;
wn=[wp,ws]; 
[n]=buttord(wp,ws,ap,as);
[b,a]=butter(n,wn,'stop');
w=0:0.01:pi; h=freqz(b,a,w); 
p=angle(h); mag=20*log10(abs(h)); 
subplot(2,1,1);
plot(w/pi,mag); 
grid; 
xlabel('normalized frequency'); 
ylabel('magnitude in db-->'); 
title('magnitude response(band stop filter)'); 
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(w/pi,p); 
grid;
xlabel('normalized frequency-->'); 
ylabel('phase in radians-->'); 
title('phase response(bandstop filter)');

RESULT: 
 
Thus the IIR Butterworth Band Stop Filter was designed and executed using MATLAB.
