DESIGN OF SAMPLING RATE CONVERTOR BY RATIONAL FACTOR 
	
 
AIM: 
          To perform sampling rate conversion by rational factor I/D’ 
 
SOFTWARE REQUIRED: 
           MATLAB  (R2020)  version. 
 
ALGORITHM: 
	Start the program 
	Generate  the  input signal    
	Sample the given signal to get sampled signal 
	Perform sampling rate conversion by rational factor I/D 
	Plot the input signal, resampled output for factor I/D 
	Stop the program  
 
 
PROGRAM: 
 
clc; clear all;  
close all;   %Sampling rate conversion by factor I/D = 5/4 
Fx=20;     %Original sampling frequency in Hz Tx=1/Fx;     %Original sampling period in seconds tx=0:Tx:1; % Time vector tx x=0.7*sin(2*pi*tx); % Original sequence 
y=resample(x,5,4);  % Re-sampling by rational factor I/D ty=(0:(length(y)-1))*4*Tx/5;  % New time vector ty figure(1) stem(tx,x,'*') hold on stem(ty,y,'-.r') 
title('Original sequence and Sampling rate conversion by factor I/D') 
legend('Original sequence','Resampled signal by rational factor I/D') xlabel('Time (s)'),  ylabel('Amplitude'), 
axis([0,1,-1,1]) 
 
 
RESULT: 
 
 	Thus the sampling rate conversion for rational factor I/D was performed using MATLAB.
