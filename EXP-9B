SUBTRACTION USING DIRECT ADDRESSSING MODE 

AIM: 
 
To write an assembly language program to perform subtraction of two numbers using direct addressing mode. 
 
APPARATUS   REQUIRED: 
 
1.	Personal computer 
2.	RS232C interface cable 
3.	TMS320C5416 DSP Processor 
 
ALGORITHM: 
 
•	Set the data memory locations of Input 1, Input 2 and Output 
•	Start the program 
•	Initialize the data memory page. 
•	Reset the Complier mode (CPL) bit. 
•	Delay is given by NOP (No Operation). 
•	The data which is in data memory (A000H) is located to Accumulate A. 
•	The data which is in data memory (A001H) is subtracted with Accumulator A. 
•	Accumulator A Result is stored at A002H. 
•	Halt the program. 
 
 
PROGRAM: 
 
INP1 .SET 0H 
INP2 .SET 1H OUT .SET 2H

RESULT: 
 
Thus the Assembly language program for substraction of two numbers using direct addressing mode was performed and implemented using TMS320C5416 DSP processor.
